Configuration files

# Steps to setup on fresh machine (Windows)
1. Take a gun
2. Kill yourself
3. Directory structure should be:  
   * /Users/epberry/Vim
   ** vim74
   ** vimfiles
   ** \_vimrc

# Problems
1. I think the zsh config script auto sets the PATH which may make it wrong in some cases - check the PATH in the .zsrhc if there are problems
2. Copy mode is kinda fucked - just need to figure out how to use it properly
3. Switching light vs dark colors is kinda screwy too, improve this a little

# Common TMUX commands
1. Resize windows with keyboard: CTRL B + ALT <arrow key>
2. See this URL for more: https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#basic-example

# Changing light and dark colorschemes
1. Set background to light in vimrc
2. Change terminal profile to use light or dark (GUI option for iTERM, ./set_light or ./set_dark)
